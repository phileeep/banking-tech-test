# Bank Tech Test

## The Challenge
To build a banking app that handles: 
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).
- Dealing with edge user cases.
- Having good test coverage. 

# To build 
- Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:phileeep/banking-tech-test.git

```

- Open:
```
SpecRunner.html
```

- Basic Commands:
```
const bank = new Bank
bank.deposit(100)
bank.withdraw(10)
bank.printBalance()
```

- The commands and response will all happen in the console.
